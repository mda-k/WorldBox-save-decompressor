INFO ABOUT THE PROGRAMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

DECOMPRESSOR:

-needs a .wbox file
-you need to include the .wbox file in the input path (first entry).
-you need to give it the path of a folder you want the program to output the .json file to (second entry).
-the last entry is just a read-only status thingy.
-make backups before using the program.
-will overwrite files of the same name. for example, if you have map.wbox, and map.json (from another map.wbox)
 in the same folder, it will overwrite the first map.json.
-will crash from the slightest typo.


RECOMPRESSOR:

-needs the original .wbox file, the edited .json file.
-will overwrite the original .wbox file, but leave the .json file as is.
-first field requires you the path of the folder which has the original .wbox and the edited .json file. please only
 leave those two files in that folder, no other files.
-will probably crash too from a slight typo in the path.
