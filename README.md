this repository just contains 2 programs. one to decompress .wbox worldbox saves into .json saves, which you can edit in VS, or just notepad (better choice in my opinion). and when you are done, just recompress it with the other.
this isn't going to be developed much most likely...



also, this program is nowhere near perfect, so don't expect much :). i put it together in a total of an hour or so.



sources are in sources.txt. instructions and some info on how to use these programs.
