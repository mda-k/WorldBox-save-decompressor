this is a really basic python script to decompress .wbox worldbox saves into .json saves, which you can edit in VS, or just notepad.
yet, i haven't made the recompressor, so this isn't a practical tool yet...



also, this program is nowhere near perfect, so don't expect much :). i put it together in 20 minutes or so.
